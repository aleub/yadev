personal site project to get the coffee/nodejs/jade/bdd stuff...

# Demo
everyone loves demos, so here a (hopefully) working demo:
http://79.125.10.39/
http://79.125.10.39:3001


# Usage
to use the src you need a recent version of nodejs and coffee-script.

to get coffeescript:

    npm install -g coffee-script

checkout the source:

    git clone git://github.com/leubnerandre/yadev.git
    cd ./yadev

to install all dependencies:

    npm install

and finally to run the code:

    coffee app.coffee

now, cross your fingers and hit http://localhost:3000 in your favorite browser


To actually do something with it you need a mongodb instance running on localhost:27017
