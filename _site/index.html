  <h1>Dotfiles</h1>

<p>Since a colleague of mine always asks about my current vim config, i updated my dotfiles repository on github <a href="https://github.com/leubnerandre/dotfiles">here</a>. Those include my vimrc, .vim, zshrc, Xresources and screenrc. </p>

<p>To get it working, first you should move your own files to a safe place. If you want to change stuff the way you want it, fork the repo. Then clone youre own, or my repo, cd into the newly created repo and install them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> ~
git clone https://github.com/leubnerandre/dotfiles
<span class="nb">cd </span>dotfiles
make install
make update
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using this method youre keeping all your config files in a convenient place, just pointing to them using symlinks. The last command is a oneline makefile entry which runs git pull in every directory in ~/.vim/bundle, that fetches the most recent git version from each vim plugin. If you havn&#39;t noticed already, i&#39;m managing my plugins via <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen</a>, it&#39;s neat to put your newly discovered vim plugin in the bundle folder and your good to go. However, i should mention there is a better way of using vim plugins in your personal dotfiles, which is adding them through git submodules, but i couldnt figure it out when i did this setup and this solution works aswell.</p>

<h1>.vimrc</h1>

<p>I realized the vimrc file is quite well commented, no need to go through every line. The original file is not written by me, however i dont remember where i found it.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/leubnerandre/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc">my vimrc here</a>.</p>

<p>In combination with urxvt ( + nice Xresources) it provides you with this eyecandy:</p>

    <small data-timestamp="Thu, 23 May 2013 14:17:10 +0200" >I wrote this {{timestamp}}</small>
  </header>
  <p>I just found out about a nice feature to use the clipboard over remote ssh connection in linux. Just connect via</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>ssh -Y host.example.com
</code></pre></div>
<p>To automate this you have to add the host to your ssh config file in ~/.ssh/config :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">Host</span> <span class="n">host</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
  <span class="no">ForwardAgent</span> <span class="n">yes</span>
  <span class="no">ForwardX11</span> <span class="n">yes</span>
  <span class="no">ForwardX11Trusted</span> <span class="n">yes</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The ForwardAgent is optional, but its nice if you use a private key with a secret and dont want to copy it to several servers.</p>

  <p>First off, i like Linux, most specificly, Arch Linux. I <em>grew up</em> with various Distributions, starting with Suse, redhat, Linux From Scratch, debian, ubuntu. In the end im pretty much happy with Arch for the last 4 or 5 years.</p>

<p>The Rolling release model of arch makes it easy as heck staying on up-to-date software. And with the aur Community Packages youre living on the edge, if you like that.</p>

<p>WTF no mac</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any statistics about it, but, looking at photos from conferences i guess a good 80% of web development is done on mac, and i get the point. Still, deep inside my heart, i think open source is the better solution in the end.</p>

<p>Vim</p>

<p>I dont like the concept of using an ide, mostly because they dont last very long, trends and languages change, and so do the IDE coming with them. Hence the only thing i couldnt live without is my pretty vim. There is always someone who is porting the basic stuff for that fancy new language into vim, its been there since soooo long, and i would guess it will last me (hopefully).</p>

<p>There are a few plugins i use alot, ctrl-p, tabbar, powerline, various linter&#39;s, easymotion and pathogen to keep all of them up to date and nicely ordered. I will try to cover them later on.</p>

<p>Xfce</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been a couple since xfce 3.x, got my pretty much same setup since that. It&#39;s fast, simplistic, beutiful and easy to configure. It does not try to push me in a specific direction (I&#39;m pointing to you, gnome) and just works, without any fancy anything.</p>

<p>urxvt &amp; zsh &amp; tmux</p>

<p>These 3 programs combined are soo powerful. I&#39;ll try to write up some nice use case scenarios later.</p>

  <p>Hello, world! Here i am, blogging. Although i don&#39;t now yet where this will end, i fired up my beloved editor of choice, vim, and wrote some lightweight static page. I&#39;m not sure which topics will dominate, but i guess it will be something about vim, linux (may include arch love), nodejs, coffescript or just hacking in general.</p>

<p>Why not use a ready to go blog engine</p>

<p>I guess thats an illness everyone has in this field, we dont like other people code. We dont know them, we dont trust them, we think we can make something better, nicer, faster, whatnots. Lets see ...</p>

<p>The menu is not yet working, not sure how to implement a linkable, search engine safe and easy to work with Router in a one page layout without server. Some scrollspy and history hashing magic i would guess.</p>
