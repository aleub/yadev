  <h1>Dragqueen</h1>
  <p>A realtime dragracing time measurement system, for which i wrote the frontend part. Unfortunately it's not open source, but believe me, its awesome! You can read and see it <a href="http://mechlab-engineering.de/blog/">here</a></p>

  <p>The software is running on an itx apu board. The server is written using coffescript, express.js, socket.io, jade and mongodb. The build process is automated using cake.</p>

  <p>For the frontend we used Twitter bootstrap, stylus and the jade templating engine. This combination comes with all the nuts and bolts to handle the UI in the browser.</p>
