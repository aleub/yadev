Hello, world! Here i am, blogging. Although i don't now yet where this will end, i fired up my beloved editor of choice, vim, and wrote some lightweight static page. I'm not sure which topics will dominate, but i guess it will be something about vim, linux (may include arch love), nodejs, coffescript or just hacking in general.

Why not use a ready to go blog engine

I guess thats an illness everyone has in this field, we dont like other people code. We dont know them, we dont trust them, we think we can make something better, nicer, faster, whatnots. Lets see ...

The menu is not yet working, not sure how to implement a linkable, search engine safe and easy to work with Router in a one page layout without server. Some scrollspy and history hashing magic i would guess.
